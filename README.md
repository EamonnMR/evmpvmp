# EV MP MVP

Networked multiplayer asteroids-style combat in Godot.

Built to sort of scratch an itch: can [EV](http://escape-velocity.games) mechanics work in a multiplayer setting?

Also functions as a demo for multi-scene client/server godot projects.

Assets are [Onyx's old shipyard](https://archive.org/details/onyx_shipyard), CC BY NC (plus some PD stuff; assets are as marked in folder names)

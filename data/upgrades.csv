2,Applique,3,100,"Survival in space depends on keeping space on the outside and air on the inside. Sure, everyone drills for hull breach - reach for masks and gloves, don helmets, communicate by radio and hand sign. But at the end of the day, the ship that keeps its atmosphere usually wins the fight. Sometimes that means welding on additional pieces of armor over weak spots, even if the design does not call for them",sprites/onyx_cc_nc/icons/upg_2.png,armor,10

6,Missile,5,500,The design of these hasn’t changed much. Suppose the fins give it away; those are for use in-atmo. It would be more of a hassle to stop putting fins on missiles at this point.,sprites/onyx_cc_nc/icons/upg_6.png,weapon,5

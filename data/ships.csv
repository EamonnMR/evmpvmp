Though it’s the largest ship in production, it’s size is deceptive – in order to reach the cargo sections, you need to spacewalk across the frame."

This slab of a ship has stuck around for a long time and shows no sign of stopping. Crews may swear at its unreliable electronics or tight corridors, but they swear by its battering-ram hull and simplicity of maintenance."

This ship has very little to recommend it besides its huge cargo section. The tiny crew section is unbelievably cramped and if you should find yourself in pirate space, you’d better be good at talking your way out of truble. You certainly won’t be flying or shooting your way out."

It’s often used as a yacht or executive transport, but once they get enough lightyears on them they pop up on the secondary market, where they make a passable courier. They also make a solid if small contribution to planetary defense forces."

Not just an acclaimed cargo ship, the Loxodont is also the way WarpCorp has begun to project power."

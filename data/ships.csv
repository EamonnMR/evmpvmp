The AI runs the ship, so it can be operated with a skeleton crew if needed."
7,Harrier,0,2000,4.3,1.6,140,10,20,,10,gameplay/ships/harrier.tscn,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2311 Upgrade,sprites/onyx_cc_nc/readout/7.png,sprites/onyx_cc_nc/icons/7.bmp,0x2,"Old technolgy in a still-competitive package. The Compact has all but phased this fighter out, but you can still find examples on the civilian market and in the hands of independent planets."

Though it’s the largest ship in production, it’s size is deceptive – in order to reach the cargo sections, you need to spacewalk across the frame."

This slab of a ship has stuck around for a long time and shows no sign of stopping. Crews may swear at its unreliable electronics or tight corridors, but they swear by its battering-ram hull and simplicity of maintenance."

Most ships start with a spaceframe, engine, or cargo configuration and work from there. The Screamer was built around its massive beam. It’s got one job, as they say."

Faster than it’s got any right to be at its size and overarmed, the Raptor is a ship to be feared (and best engaded from far away.)"

This ship has very little to recommend it besides its huge cargo section. The tiny crew section is unbelievably cramped and if you should find yourself in pirate space, you’d better be good at talking your way out of truble. You certainly won’t be flying or shooting your way out."
17,Mako,0,7000,3.2,0.9,125,20,20,,30,gameplay/ships/mako.tscn,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,VTOL Spaceplane,sprites/onyx_cc_nc/readout/17.png,sprites/onyx_cc_nc/icons/17.bmp,0x2,"The Mako really shines in atmosphere, but you’re here for microgravity performance, we get that. It’s often used as a yacht or executive transport, but once they get enough lightyears on them they pop up on the secondary market, where they make a passable courier. They also make a solid if small contribution to planetary defense forces."
18,Pacer,1,5000,2.4,0.6,116,25,20,,50,gameplay/ships/pacer.tscn,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,Fast Cargo,sprites/onyx_cc_nc/readout/18.png,sprites/onyx_cc_nc/icons/18.bmp,0x2,Frequent contender for the ten-star grand prix. Substantial cargo capacity and big enough engines to fly it into next week.
